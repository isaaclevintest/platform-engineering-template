# Dev Box Samples

This folder contains a handful of samples to showcase how to use [Dev Box Customizations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/how-to-customize-dev-box-setup-tasks). These samples take advantage of the defined tasks in the [Tasks](/Tasks/) folder. 

## How to use

The simplest way to use these samples is to do the following.
- Fork this repo
- Add forked repo as [catalog to your Dev Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/deployment-environments/how-to-configure-catalog). 
- Take one of the yaml files in this folder and upload it when you create a new Dev Box for your project linked to a Dev Center with that catalog
